This is an example post with some [geojson](https://geojson.org/) code. The support is provided thanks to [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). To create your own visualization, go to [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/).

````markdown
```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {},
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [175.496847, -40.357404]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
```


Which generates:

```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {},
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [175.496847, -40.357404]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
