Need to start flying? We got you covered! 

Mystacina Solutions was born from our experience working with people from over forty countries in data analysis for research, applied science, and communication. While meeting the high demand for data analysis skills, we also recognized a pervasive need for better listening, self-reflection, and constructive feedback in our communities. At Mystacina Solutions, we offer tailored solutions designed to help you thrive in your career. Our work packages include **self-development**, **data analysis**, **writing**, and **workshops**. Visit our [services page](https://renatamuy.github.io/mystacina/services/) and explore our [credentials](https://renatamuy.github.io/mystacina/people/) to learn how we can support your **success**.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
